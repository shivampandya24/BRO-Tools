# BRO Tools
BRO (Backup, Restore, and Other Utility tools) is a collection of tools for day-to-day use on your server. This tool helps you to setup automated backup of your database files as well as storage (as of today). However, in future, we will keep adding more tools which can be useful. 

## Why?
There are many tools in the market which satisfy these requirements. However, there are multiple reasons behind developing this tool; such as:

 1. They does not satisfy our requirements 100% (In some case).
 2. Many of them are paid one.
 3. Sometimes it is hard to configure or confusing.
 4. And of course, improve coding skills üòâ


## How to use?

### Dependency
* Python (Tested with Python 3.13.2)

### Install required libraries/ packages

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
*Using password on command line involve security risk. Use with caution.(See roadmap below)*

                 [--db_name DB_NAME] [--user USER] [--password PASSWORD] [--host HOST] [--storage_type {local,s3,ftp}]
